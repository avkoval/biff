# Biff

A Clojure web framework for solo developers. See [biffweb.com](https://biffweb.com).

## Contributing

Documentation source is located at [github.com/jacobobryant/biffweb.com](https://github.com/jacobobryant/biffweb.com),
under `content/docs`. Feel free to submit corrections.

Also check out the [content library](https://biffweb.com/docs/library/). If you write a how-to guide (could be as simple
as pasting some code into a gist) or other Biff-related blog post, I'll add it there.

PRs for the code are also welcome. To hack on Biff, either run `bb dev` or `cd starter; clj -M:dev dev`. (The starter
project's deps.edn declares a local dependency on the Biff library code.)

## Sponsors
